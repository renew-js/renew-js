# renew-js

[Renew][1] is a multi-formalism editor and simulator that provides a flexible 
modeling approach. With renew-js we want to improve the user interaction with 
the editor. To archive a multi-formalism editor and simulator we base the 
formalisms on metamodels and provide a plugin-architecture to extend
domain specific languages.

## Instructions

- git clone renew-js project
- git submodule init and update
- run npm install
