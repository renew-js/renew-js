# renew-js

[Renew][1] is a multi-formalism editor and simulator that provides a flexible 
modeling approach. With renew-js we want to improve the user interaction with 
the editor. To archive a multi-formalism editor and simulator we base the 
formalisms on metamodels and provide a plugin-architecture to extend
domain specific languages.

## Getting started

To startup a development build you just need to checkout this project with its submodules and run `npm install` afterwards.
Then you can start up the dev server in the renew-ui with `npm run serve`.
